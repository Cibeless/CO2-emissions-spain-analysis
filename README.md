# Analysis and Prediction of CO₂ Emissions — Globa - Brazil - Spain

This project presents a detailed analysis of Spain's carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions over time, using historical data from the Kaggle dataset: CO₂ & GHG Emissions Data. This project is analytical and educational. The forecast uses simple linear regression based on historical trends and does not replace advanced climate models.
